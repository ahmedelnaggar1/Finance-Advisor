# Investment-Advisor

Investment Advisor is a program developed to act as a personal advisor for people interested in proliferating their income through savings accounts and was developed as part of assessment. 

The sceneraio given was to make it easier for a person to choose between savings accounts offered by three institutes:

* Amscot Brokerage

* Bank West

* SEQ Building Society

Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages, thus the app tries to make it easier for interested parties in making a decision.
